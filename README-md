# Undergrad Research
## Authors: Katrina Bawar, Amithi Pathak

This repository contains our undergrad research work involving Dafny verification and skeletal animation linear blend skinning with `three.js`. The code is written using Dafny and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- **DualNum.dfy**: Implementation of dual numbers, including lemmas for dual conjugates, inverses, and square roots, along with a `Math` class for `sqrt` and `pow` functions.
- **quicksort.dfy**: A quicksort implementation in Dafny, including helper functions such as `swap` and `partition`, and a recursive `quickSort` method.
- **three.js Animation**: An HTML and JavaScript-based project demonstrating LBS using `three.js`.

## Files

### `DualNum.dfy`
Contains the following:

- **Math Class**: Implements basic functions such as `sqrt` and `pow`.
- **DualNumbers Class**: Implements dual numbers operations including:
  - Dual conjugates.
  - Lemmas for properties like multiplication and inverse.
  - Functions for computing the inverse and square root of dual numbers.

#### Action Items in `DualNum.dfy`
- Write math functions for `sqrt` and `pow`.
- Explore the concept of complex conjugates in the `Complex` class for Lemma 6.
- Investigate how to write proofs for solving variables in Dafny.

### `quicksort.dfy`
This file contains the quicksort algorithm implemented in Dafny. It includes:
- swap: Swaps elements in an array.
- partition: Partitions the array and returns the pivot index.
- quickSort: Recursively sorts the array.
- printArr: A utility method for printing the array.

### 'index.html' (three.js Animation)
This file demonstrates skeletal animation blending using three.js. It is a modification to the original example found on the three.js examples page,
using source code at https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_animation_skinning_blending.html
It includes:
A 3D model loaded using the GLTFLoader. (From source code)
Controls for crossfading between idle, walk, and run animations. (From source code)
GUI elements for controlling the animation and the bone rotation. (Original code)
